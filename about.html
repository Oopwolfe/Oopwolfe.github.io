            Hello! My name is Jason Gao and I am a third year Digital Arts and Science (DAS) student at the University of Florida. 
            </p>

            <p>
            Based in Gainesville, Florida, I am an aspiring 3D Artist with an interest in environmental design as well as Virtual Production. In college my focus surrounded camera operation and 3D environments/Objects for games. I would love to combine the two to create amazing realistic videos and other forms of media through the booming new technology that is virtual production.
            </p>
            <p>
            I've worked on three small games of different genres, The first being a solo developed short Maze game called Dungeon Gems where you run around a maze and collect all the gems. The second was a team built souls-like fighting game called Cavity Crusaders . You play as a dentist fighting off food monster in a mouth with a toothbrush. The third was another solo developed Escape room puzzle game called Remembrance. you uncover the story of you character while solving puzzles in order to escape the house you are trapped in.
            
            </p>
            <p>
            I've also created 3D Assets and animations as projects for school, while also creating my own object and environment by myself.             
            </p>
            <p>
            My favorite types of game to play are single-player story driven games, but I find myself spending more time playing competitive multiplayer games. I love games like Red Dead Redemption 2, The Evil Within 2, and Firewatch. But I also play quite a bit of league of legends.
            </p>
